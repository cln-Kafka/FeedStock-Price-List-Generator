# FeedStock

This is kinda a side project for an animal feed store. The app is a tool where the store owner inputs the prices for his products which comes with different packages/weights option (25kg, 50kg, ton). then the app dynamically generates an image of these prices that can be saved locally or shared to other platforms such as Facebook, WhatsApp, Telegram, and more.

## Installation

You can view it on your phone (Android only) by installing [this file](READEME-Assets/built-app/الحنش للأعلاف.apk).

## A Discussion for the learning process

A previous version of this app was relying on overlaying prices on a pre-made price list image made by the store. But this was dumped by going to generate images dynamically as the original image was very low quality.

## Potential Improvements

One potential improvement is to give the user more customizability by enabling him to enter products and their available packages instead of fixed products. But this doesn't suit lower-tech educated people so it isn't implemented. and it is mostly unnecessary.
